The biggest thanks goes to [Kinsights](https://kinsights.com) for sponsoring Hello Web App on Kickstarter, and in particular for pushing the campaign over its goal. A bit about them:

*Kinsights is a free advice-sharing network for parents. Get advice from parents that you'll actually use.  Learning Django? Join a group of other Django-loving parents here: [https://kinsights.com/for/django](https://kinsights.com/for/django)*

What a great resource after you're done with this book!

## Book reviewers, editors, and testers

I tested (and tested, and tested) this book and yet things still snuck through. The hugest thanks to those that took the time to review, edit, and run all the code bits contained within this book — your feedback was invaluable.
