You'll probably spend more time trying to fix random errors than you will
building your app. You might have heard jokes of programmers spending all night
trying to fix an error only to find out that they were missing a simple comma.
So if you run into an error, you're not alone — debugging happens to the best of
us. If you're stuck, here's some ideas to help you debug your app.

## Error pages *usually* help you find the problem
{% endfilter %}

<figure class="caption">
    <img src="/static/images/tutorial/syntax.png" alt=""/>
</figure>

{% filter markdown %}
Generally the error page you get when developing locally will tell you what and
where the problem is. Here, I have a syntax error on line 13 in my *views.py*
file. 

The offending line:

{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
return render(request, ‘search/search.html' {
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

Nothing obvious on first glance, but it really should be:

{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
return render(request, 'search/search.html', {
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

Missing comma! Those pesky things. Easy to fix once you find it, though.

What do you do if your error page isn't so helpful?

## Googling the error usually comes up with helpful answers
{% endfilter %}

<figure class="caption">
    <img src="/static/images/tutorial/so-error.png" alt=""/>
</figure>

{% filter markdown %}
Copy/paste the error into Google and chances are, someone else had the same
error and it's already answered — usually on Stack Overflow
([http://hellowebapp.com/36](http://hellowebapp.com/36)), which is an immensely
helpful website that people use to ask and answer programming questions.

## Ask for help

You might have scanned your code inch by inch looking for the issue, and
Googling isn't helping. What now?

### IRC

IRC is essentially chat, with "rooms" that can be based around a topic, like
Django. It's a little complicated to get going and might seem intimidating, but
generally the strangers and future friends on IRC are happy to help others who
are having problems.

If you already know how to use IRC, here are a couple channels on freenode to
ask questions:

* `#django`
* `#python`
* `##learnpython`
* `#pyladies`

(Of course, make sure to be polite and specific as possible when explaining your
problem.)

New to IRC? Check out our IRC page on the Hello Web App GitHub page here:
[http://hellowebapp.com/37](http://hellowebapp.com/37).

### Stack Overflow

Obviously, you can also ask for help on Stack Overflow. Just like IRC, make sure
to be as descriptive as possible when explaining your issue. Here's a link to
ask a question on Stack Overflow:
[http://hellowebapp.com/38](http://hellowebapp.com/38).

### Mailing List

There is a django-users mailing list
([http://hellowebapp.com/39](http://hellowebapp.com/39)) where people ask
questions and help each other. If you're not in a rush, this could be a good
place to write up your problem and get some feedback on how to proceed.

Before posting, it's good form to search through the
archive([http://hellowebapp.com/40](http://hellowebapp.com/40)) to see if
somebody asked a similar question yet. This will also help you get a feel for
the format that most messages are in.

### Meetups and developer events

Need face to face help? There are hundreds of meetups and developer events
worldwide, and there is likely one in the city near you. Here are some great
organizations that run meetups and places to find meetups:

* PyLadies ([http://hellowebapp.com/41](http://hellowebapp.com/41))
* Python meetups on Meetup.com
    ([http://hellowebapp.com/42](http://hellowebapp.com/42))
* Django Girls ([http://hellowebapp.com/43](http://hellowebapp.com/43))

You can also search for "Python meetup YOURCITY" to see if there is something
happening near you.

These events are also a great place to meet new friends and expand your
programming community!
